const may27th = `I know how this website of mine has made you feel. 
I had something <em>grand</em> planned for you, but it was unfinished. 
I should have waited before I got your hopes up only to kill them.
This website is a reminder that things will be different, and will continue to. 
I want you to know that things really will be different this time, compared to the last summer.
You left last year unsure, unhappy, heartbroken, and disgusted.
I want you to leave this time knowing you have someone waiting that truly loves you and cares about you.
Someone that can't sleep without you.
Someone that still needs you as their alarm in the morning.
I meant everything I said that day.
I want to carry your fragile little self up the mountain.
I want to toughen up my body for the world and I want to soften my hands for you.
I want to show you what you mean to me instead of just telling you.
I want to show you with my words instead of just telling you with my words.
Does that make sense?
I love you so much and I want to continue to water you and our love every single day.
I require a few things from you too.
I require patience. I need you to be more patient with me.
I need you to try and let go of who I once was, just as I did with you.
Don't tell me whose pain was worse because you can't compare that.
I need you to understand where I come from when I speal today, and to not put my words into the Ali of the past.
I can't grow if you do that. I can't grow if you make me believe I can't grow.
I'm not saying you do it or you don't, I just want to lay this boundary now.
We aren't who we were, and we won't be soon who we are.
We can't want to move forward while looking back.
I need you to know that this summer is going to be very difficult for me.
I'm going to miss you an <em>unimaginable</em> amount and I'm going to do absolutely everything it takes for us to get to that next level.
You make me swoon. You make me blush. You give me confidence. You fight with me then give me bose. We play and watch and laugh and cry and fight and have ta2a time. I'm with you every breath I take away from work and now I have no idea what our lives will look like for the next 3 months. 90 days.
This letter is half written now and the other half is what I had written down to add to the site when I learn to create databases in my next unit in bootcamp.
I wanted to die last night after feeling like I failed you yet again after just turning a new leaf earlier this week.
You just told me <em>I don't trust you when you say that</em> after I said <em>You'll like it</em> ;/ 
I don't want you to ever ever ever EVER feel that way again. I love you more than anything.
Think about it for a second.
What do you see me loving?
What proof do you have I don't love you more than anything?
Can you prove that false rumor?
Can you prove that false rumor when you say <em>You don't love me anymore?</em>
I love you Jenin. I have to stop writing here because you're getting angry...
:) I can't wait to watch this next episode with you!
<br><br> With love,
<br> Your husband.

const may28th = `I'm sorry about today ;/
I don't know what happened but I'm telling you I am and will work so hard to stop anything like today from happening again.
I don't want it to seem like part of the pattern the next time it happens, but something excuseable and different from the norm.
There are so many things for me to work on when you're away, and I am going to do have to do so much of it alone this time.
We might have less time together than we did last summer, where I would wake up and sleep to accommodate for your timings, and my days were completely free for you.
That won't be the case anymore. My schedule will be strict, my love. 
I'm so worried about what our summer will be like I can't help but find ways now to ease the transition on your very first day there.
Every day I get closer to it my throat gets heavier. 
This is a pain that won't go away for the next 3 months, and will be the worst on the day you leave.
It will get easier as the days count down till the day you come back, and I'm praying we find as many ways possible to maximize the amount and quality of our time together this summer.
I want to do so many things for you while you're gone and you will be back in time close to your birthday!
It's crazy how time flew by since your last, and the summer seems like it will be shorter than the last.
If we spend it in happiness, the summer will fly by.
If we tell ourselves the things we do when you're away are enough and equivalent to the games we play when you're here and the time we spend, we will be okay, I promise you that.
We just have to think of it like school is starting again and we can't hangout as much!
We're both just busy with school baby!
Last summer, we took no steps forward and a lot of steps back until the very end, but this year we will continue to fight the tides and swim above the water, I promise you that too.
We finished pinocchio today and I'm so sad ;( Weeeee.
I can't wait for all the other things we will watch and play when you're in palestine!
If we spend less time playing things we can spend more time watching shows, just like we did this week!
New K Dramas and animes and Last of Us... we have so much to watch!
So many games for us to play too! Yes they're not val or overwatch, but this will help us get a break from them.
We will get to relax and play cuter more relaxing games and widen our library of games.
I will research everyday more games we can play shows we can watch.
I might have to start getting up super duper early....but let's see how it goes baby.
I love you so much bubby. You making me tear up. I don't want you to go.
I love you more today than I've ever loved you in the past.
I will write these letters to you every single day. I will make you happier going forward than you've ever been.
I will show you the love I found today that you couldn't see yesterday, and the love tomorrow you can't see today.
I want to get closer everyday to bringing you peace and ease and I want to outdo all the expectations you could possibly have, my princess.
I can't wait to continue to show you what you mean to me.
<br><br> With love,
<br>Your husband.

const may29th = `I'm going to miss you so much. Every hour that we get closer to your last gets infinitely harder. I'm worrying about different ways for us to spend our time. Better ways to spend our time.
But the more I look for better things to do, the more I realize that it really is all just the same as long as I have time with you. As long as we're doing anything at all. The thought is comforting and makes the summer seem easier.
What worries me about summer isn't not being able to play but it's the time difference combined with our schedules. I can't wake up and sleep with you anymore. That's the hardest part.
I can't fall asleep to your voice, but you can to mine. You can call me whenever at any time of the day, but I can't do it with you if you're in the room with others, which you will be, unless I text you and you call me and we sit in silence.
We each will have similar yet different struggles this summer. You can call me to fall asleep with me any time, but I can not do that with you. I need you when I sleep. I need you to explain something to me.
Tell me about some new skincare. Tell me about how Ulta points work. Tell me about it all and do it all over again a thousand times. I love it the same every single time. I will never get bored of your words that put me to sleep and will always love them more the second time.
Put me to sleep Jenin. When will you be able to put me to sleep again? It'll be 8am for you when I'm sleeping. How can I go 3 months without you putting me to sleep? How can you think this is going to be harder for you?
You're going to be in a different place that isn't full of memories with you. A refreshing change of pace filled with people and activities and community. I am noneney here. I'm all alone. 
My days will be quiet and my nights quieter. I will be living in sadness looking over at my phone every second to see if you woke up in the middle of the night and need me enough to fight your sticky eyes and text me, until you fall asleep again.
I won't know when you fall asleep. I won't be able to hear your breaths get heavy and loud and slow. I won't be able to hear you shift around in the middle of the night. I won't be able to feel your anger when I wake up late.
I won't be able to finish my class knowing I have you waiting for me, because you'll be getting ready for bed in a room with 2 other people. We're going to lose some of our most intimate moments and you will be surrounded by people throughout that hardship, but I will be left here all alone.
A house much quiter than the one I was in last summer. When mama passed, the house died. You keep my house alive Jenin. My house is going to be dead this summer. I am going to start looking to start a new life somewhere else and make plans to leave this house without hearing your laughter and anger sitting in this basement I fell in love with you in. The room we shared so many emotions in. The room I spent hundreds of hours playing the piano for you in. 
Nothing is going to be the same again after you leave this summer. I love you more than last year and you love me more too. I don't know what to do with myself when I'm not around you.
<br><em>You're all I know.</em><br>
Let's wake up and go back to the start of this month. This has been the most beautiful peaceful month I've had with you. We haven't talked about it, but we've fought the least this month.
We've been the most hopeful for the future this month. We've started looking forward. We've made so much more time out of the less time we've had this month.
I don't want you to go and it's breaking me. It's hitting me so hard right now as I type this letter. Why does it feel like I'm losing you? <br>
Why does it feel like I'm saying goodbye? Why is your laughter playing back in my head again and again and again? <br> Why is it already beginning to feel like a memory?
Why is it fair I get 2 hours a day with you if I'm lucky? I don't want to make you sad. I know the last few letters and even the beginning of this letter seemed happy and hopeful, but I'm so sad now.
I will destory absolutely EVERYTHING if I feel you move even an inch farther away from me this summer. An ounce of love lost is all of love lost, and I'm serious. I need updates from you as often as you possibly can. There is no sitting on your phone allowed when we're both awake and you have the chance to text me. You chose to leave me alone here and you have to make it up somehow.
I want to throw a brick at your face for breaking my heart, but I love you and you're my littlest lily of the valley and I must carry you to the top of this mountain, no matter how tall it is. I love you and I'm sorry for making this letter sad but I can't even believe how sad this is making me. I thought I would handle it well, but honestly I have no idea how to. 
I need you to take the planning of our schedules seriously. Please. I'm telling you Jenin, you are all I have. I don't want to go to school anymore for 3 months. I want to hang out with you after school. I don't wanna do my homework. I wanna skip class and meet you in the hallways. I want to get in my car and drive us around during school hours. I don't care about stupid school anymore. I want to get away. With you. Please let me ruin your schedule. Please grant me that gift. And please find ways to show me your love when you're there. When we can't send each other gifts. When we have 2 hours a day together. Please find something and help us. I love you Jenin. I typed this letter out completely with one hand because I didn't have bandaids small enough for my finger and it's making it real hard to use my left hand to type. I'm sitting here waiting for you very patiently. It has been 20 minutes. You lied to me ;/ I miss you baby. Please hurry. It's our last night together. 
I love you Janooti. Ba7ebek too much!!!
<br><br>With love,<br><br>
Your husband.
